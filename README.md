 I am by all means not supporting the Chinese Communist Party in it's mission to oppress the hard-working wonderful Chinese people. This is just to spread awareness of the terrible government atrocities that are happening in China. Free speach is one of the most important factors in having a working democracy (something that the Chinese government directly opposes).
